- Scale data 

- Apply PCA, n_components explain 90% variance / random_state=RANDOM_STATE

- explained variance of 3 PC print(np.round(pca.explained_variance_ratio_[:3],3))
- n_components 
- plot 2 most important PC

- elbow method to select optimal number of clusters (kmeans.inertia_ )
"calculating the sum of squared distances from each point to its assigned center(distortions)."
- plot elbow graph

- crosstab to evaluate missclassification

- try other clustering technique: Agglomerative 

- Compare ARI of clustering
